# EEG-Based Attention Detection


## Overview
The exploration of EEG signals for attention detection is an exciting interdisciplinary field that combines neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. By measuring brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG), researchers can assess attention levels, which has significant implications for educational settings.
